# friend-finder

friend-finder is a match making app designed for making lasting friendships. The way it works is that users take a quick survey and based on those results the program will match the users to one another based on the best fit. This application was created in week 13 of the Coding Bootcamp at UT-Austin, Houston. 

In the application, users will enter their name, submit a picture and take a short ten question survery. Based on their ranking of the statements on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree) the application will match them to their most suitable friend and a modal will appear displaying their image. 

his application was designed in order to exhibit my profencies in both back-end and front-end programming. This application utilizes a server via express and is hosted on heroku. This application implements the materialize design library and therefore is mobile view appropriate.
